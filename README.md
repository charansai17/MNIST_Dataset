MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.Every MNIST data point, every image, can be thought of as an array of numbers describing how dark each pixel is. Since each image has 28 by 28 pixels, we get a 28x28 array. We can flatten each array into a 28âˆ—28=784 dimensional vector.
 While the MNIST data points are embedded in 784-dimensional space, they live in a very small subspace. With some slightly harder arguments, we can see that they occupy a lower dimensional subspace.
